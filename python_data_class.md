# Understanding Python Data Classes

## Introduction
Python data classes offer a concise and powerful way to define classes for storing data. Traditionally, defining classes for data storage required writing boilerplate code for methods like `__init__`, `__repr__`, and `__eq__`. However, with Python data classes, this process becomes much simpler and more elegant.

## Basic Example
To illustrate the concept of Python data classes, let's consider a simple example of defining a class to represent a two-dimensional point. We'll compare the traditional implementation with Python data classes to showcase the difference in code complexity and readability.

## Using Python Data Classes
We'll explore how to use Python data classes by importing the `dataclass` decorator from the `dataclasses` module. This decorator automatically generates methods like `__init__`, `__repr__`, and `__eq__` based on the defined fields, eliminating the need for manual implementation of these methods.

## Understanding Data Classes
In this section, we'll delve deeper into the inner workings of Python data classes. We'll discuss the role of the `__init__` method in initializing class instances, the purpose of the `__repr__` method for representing objects as strings, and the functionality of the `__eq__` method for comparing objects.

## Advanced Features
Python data classes offer various advanced features to handle complex scenarios. We'll explore the use of type hints for field declarations, handling mutable default parameters with the `field` function, defining class variables, and dealing with inheritance in data classes.

## Conclusion
Python data classes provide a versatile and efficient way to define classes for storing data. By leveraging the `dataclass` decorator and its associated features, developers can streamline their code and focus on solving problems rather than writing repetitive boilerplate code.

# Python Dataclasses Example

This repository provides an example of using Python's `dataclasses` module to create classes for storing data efficiently with minimal boilerplate code.

## Introduction

Python's `dataclasses` module, introduced in Python 3.7, simplifies the process of defining classes for storing data by automatically generating common methods like `__init__`, `__repr__`, `__eq__`, etc., based on the class attributes specified. This allows developers to focus more on their data model and less on writing repetitive code.

## Example

Let's consider a simple example of a `Person` class with attributes such as `name`, `age`, and `city`. Traditionally, defining such a class would require writing explicit methods for initialization, representation, and equality comparison. However, with `dataclasses`, we can achieve the same functionality with just a few lines of code.

## Usage

Here's how we can define the `Person` class using `dataclasses`:

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age, city):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.city = city

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Person(name={self.name}, age={self.age}, city={self.city})"

    def __eq__(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, Person):
            return False
        return (self.name, self.age, self.city) == (other.name, other.age, other.city)


from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Person:
    name: str
    age: int
    city: str
