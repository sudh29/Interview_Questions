# SOLID is like a set of rules for building with LEGO blocks!

## S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):

Imagine you have a robot. The robot's job is to paint, not to cook or sing. Single Responsibility means each robot (or class) should have one main job, just like your toys do one thing really well.

## O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP):

Picture a toy box. Once you close it, you don't open the box to change a toy. Open/Closed is like saying, "Once you make your toy, you can add new toys outside the box, but you don't need to change the old ones inside."

## L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):

Think about toy cars. If a toy car can go forward, a bigger toy truck should also go forward without problems. Liskov Substitution means that you can use any type of toy where another type is expected, and it should work smoothly.

## I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):

Imagine a toy with buttons. If you only want to press one button, you don't need to see all the other buttons. Interface Segregation is like having different pages of buttons, and you only look at the page you need.

## D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):

Think about building a tower with blocks. The top block doesn't hold the tower; it depends on the blocks below. Dependency Inversion means the higher-level things depend on the lower-level things, just like the top blocks depend on the bottom ones to stay up.
So, SOLID is like building with LEGO, making sure each piece (class or toy) has a clear job, can be added to without changing the old stuff, works well in different situations, has only what you need, and everything depends on each other in the right way!
