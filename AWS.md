# Cloud computing

It refers to the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more—over the internet, allowing users to access resources on-demand without the need 
for extensive Infrastructure investments.

## Key Characteristics:

- On-Demand Self-Service: Users can provision resources as needed without human intervention from the service provider.
- Broad Network Access: Cloud services are accessible over the internet from various devices and locations.
- Resource Pooling: Providers share computing resources to serve multiple customers, allowing for cost efficiency and optimization.
- Rapid Elasticity: Services can scale up or down quickly to accommodate fluctuating workloads, ensuring performance and cost efficiency.
- Measured Service: Usage of resources is monitored, controlled, and billed transparently, providing accountability and cost control.

## Service Models:

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, such as virtual machines, storage, and networking.
- Platform as a Service (PaaS): Offers a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
- Software as a Service (SaaS): Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis, eliminating the need for installation and maintenance.

## Deployment Models:

- Public Cloud: Services are provided over the public internet and are accessible to anyone who wants to use them, offering scalability and cost efficiency.
- Private Cloud: Services are provisioned and used by a single organization, offering greater control, security, and customization.
- Hybrid Cloud: Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them, providing flexibility and optimization.

## Benefits:

- Cost Efficiency: Pay-as-you-go pricing models and economies of scale reduce upfront infrastructure costs.
- Scalability: Resources can be scaled up or down based on demand, ensuring optimal performance and cost efficiency.
- Agility: Rapid provisioning and deployment of resources enable faster time-to-market and innovation.
- Reliability: Redundant infrastructure and data replication enhance reliability and disaster recovery capabilities.
