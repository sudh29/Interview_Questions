# What is Diamond problem?
The "diamond problem" is a term in object-oriented programming that refers to an ambiguity that arises when a class inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor. This situation can create challenges in determining which version of a method or attribute the derived class should inherit, leading to potential conflicts.

Here's a simple illustration of the diamond problem:

Class A: Has a method or attribute.

Class B and C: Both inherit from Class A.

Class D: Inherits from both Class B and C.
Here's a visual representation:

Now, if both classes B and C override a method or attribute from class A, and class D inherits from both B and C, it may be unclear which version of the method or attribute class D should inherit.

This problem is more prevalent in programming languages that support multiple inheritance, where a class can inherit from more than one class.

Languages like Python address the diamond problem using a technique called "Method Resolution Order" (MRO). In Python, the C3 linearization algorithm is used to determine the order in which base classes are considered when looking up a method or attribute. This helps avoid ambiguity and defines a consistent order.

Example in Python:

In this example, the MRO ensures that the method from class B is called because it comes before the method from class C in the linearization order.

It's worth noting that while languages like Python provide mechanisms to handle the diamond problem, it's generally recommended to use composition over multiple inheritance when possible to avoid such complexities.
