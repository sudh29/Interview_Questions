# What is Diamond problem?
The "diamond problem" is a term in object-oriented programming that refers to an ambiguity that arises when a class inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor. This situation can create challenges in determining which version of a method or attribute the derived class should inherit, leading to potential conflicts.

Here's a simple illustration of the diamond problem:

Class A:
Has a method or attribute.
Class B and C:
Both inherit from Class A.
Class D:
Inherits from both Class B and C.
Here's a visual representation:
