### Create (POST):
- **Definition**: Create operation is used to add new data to the system.
- **HTTP Method**: Typically implemented using the POST method in RESTful APIs.
- **Example**: Adding a new user to a user database by sending a POST request with user data to a `/users` endpoint.

### Read (GET):
- **Definition**: Read operation is used to retrieve existing data from the system.
- **HTTP Method**: Implemented using the GET method in RESTful APIs.
- **Example**: Retrieving a list of users from a `/users` endpoint by sending a GET request.

### Update (PUT/PATCH):
- **Definition**: Update operation is used to modify existing data in the system.
- **HTTP Methods**: 
  - PUT: Typically used to update a resource entirely with a new representation. Requires sending the entire resource representation.
  - PATCH: Used to apply partial modifications to a resource. Allows sending only the fields that need to be updated.
