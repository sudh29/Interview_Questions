## Introduction

This repository aims to help individuals prepare for MongoDB-related interviews by providing a set of questions and their corresponding answers. MongoDB is a widely used NoSQL database, and understanding its key concepts is crucial for working with the database effectively.

## What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is a NoSQL, document-oriented database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like BSON documents. It differs from traditional relational databases by not requiring a predefined schema, offering scalability and adaptability to changing data requirements.

## BSON in MongoDB

BSON, or Binary JSON, is a binary-encoded serialization of JSON-like documents used by MongoDB to store data. It supports more efficient encoding and additional data types compared to JSON.

## Document in MongoDB

In MongoDB, a document is a basic unit of data storage. It is a JSON-like BSON object containing key-value pairs. Documents are stored in collections, and each document can have a different structure, allowing for flexibility in data representation.

## Collection in MongoDB

A collection in MongoDB is a group of MongoDB documents. It is the equivalent of a table in relational databases but does not enforce a schema, allowing for more dynamic and schema-less data storage.

## Indexing in MongoDB

Indexing in MongoDB involves creating indexes on specific fields to improve query performance. Indexes allow MongoDB to quickly locate and retrieve documents from a collection. Proper indexing is crucial for speeding up query execution and optimizing database performance.

## Sharding in MongoDB

Sharding is a method used to distribute data across multiple servers to improve horizontal scalability. It involves breaking a large database into smaller, more manageable pieces called shards, which are distributed across different machines.

## Replication vs. Sharding

Replication in MongoDB involves creating copies of data on multiple servers to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. Sharding, on the other hand, involves dividing a large database into smaller, more manageable parts (shards) distributed across multiple servers to improve performance and scalability.

## Write Concern in MongoDB

Write Concern in MongoDB defines the acknowledgment level for write operations. It determines the number of replicas that must acknowledge a write before the operation is considered successful. It helps balance data consistency and performance based on the application's requirements.

## Transactions in MongoDB

MongoDB supports multi-document transactions, allowing multiple operations to be grouped together as a single atomic unit. Transactions provide data consistency across multiple documents or collections, ensuring that either all operations succeed or none at all.

## Key Features of MongoDB

MongoDB is known for its flexibility, scalability, and ease of use. Its document-oriented data model, support for dynamic schemas, and horizontal scalability through sharding make it well-suited for applications with rapidly changing data requirements, large datasets, and complex data structures.
