# Type of testing

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Unit testing involves testing individual components or units of code in isolation from the rest of the system.
   - The purpose is to verify that each unit of code performs as expected and meets its design specifications.
   - It is typically conducted by developers during the development phase using testing frameworks such as Pytest, JUnit, or NUnit.

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Integration testing involves testing the interaction between different components or modules of a system.
   - The purpose is to ensure that individual units work together correctly and that interfaces between components are functioning as intended.
   - It verifies the integration points and detects any defects that may arise when integrating components.
   - It can be conducted by developers or dedicated integration testers using techniques such as top-down, bottom-up, or incremental integration.

3. **System Testing**:
   - System testing involves testing the entire system as a whole to evaluate its compliance with specified requirements.
   - It verifies that the system meets functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, reliability, security, and usability.
   - It is typically conducted by independent testers who simulate real-world scenarios and use cases to validate system behavior.

4. **Regression Testing**:
   - Regression testing involves retesting modified or updated parts of the system to ensure that existing functionality has not been adversely affected by changes.
   - The purpose is to detect and prevent regressions, i.e., unintended side effects or defects introduced by code modifications.
   - It involves rerunning previously executed tests to verify that new changes have not introduced any new bugs or broken existing functionality.

5. **Performance Testing**:
   - Performance testing involves evaluating the responsiveness, scalability, and stability of a system under different load conditions.
   - The purpose is to identify performance bottlenecks, measure system throughput, response times, and resource utilization, and ensure that the system meets performance requirements.
   - It includes various types of tests such as load testing, stress testing, endurance testing, and scalability testing.

6. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**:
   - User acceptance testing involves testing the system from the end user's perspective to determine whether it meets their needs and expectations.
   - It is usually conducted by users or stakeholders in a real-world environment or simulated environment.
   - The purpose is to validate that the system fulfills its intended purpose, is usable, and satisfies user requirements and business objectives.
   - It is the final phase of testing before the system is deployed to production.

Each type of testing serves a specific purpose and is an essential part of the software development lifecycle, ensuring the quality, reliability, and usability of the final product.
