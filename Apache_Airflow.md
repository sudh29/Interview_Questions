# Apache Airflow is 

Open-source platform for orchestrating complex workflows and data processing pipelines. It allows you to schedule, monitor, and manage workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Each node in the graph represents a task, and the directed edges define the order in which the tasks should be executed.

## Example: ETL Workflow
Suppose you have a daily ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process for a data analytics project. The workflow includes extracting data from a source, transforming it, and loading it into a destination.
