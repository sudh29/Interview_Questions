# GIT

Git operates under the hood through a combination of data structures, algorithms, and commands to manage and track changes in files and directories within a repository. Here's a simplified explanation of how Git works internally:

## Repository: 

At its core, Git revolves around the repository, which is essentially a directory that contains all the project's files and subdirectories, along with metadata related to version control.

## Object Store: 

Git stores all its data in a collection of objects within the .git directory. These objects include commits, trees, blobs (files), and tags.

## Commits: 

A commit represents a snapshot of the entire project at a particular point in time. It contains metadata such as the author, timestamp, and a reference to the parent commit(s). Each commit is uniquely identified by a SHA-1 hash.

## Trees: 

A tree object represents the state of the project's directory structure at a specific commit. It contains references to blobs (files) and other tree objects (subdirectories).

## Blobs: 

A blob object represents the content of a file at a particular point in time. Each blob is identified by its SHA-1 hash, which is calculated based on the file's content.

## Branches and Head: 

Git allows branching, which means creating divergent lines of development within the repository. Branches are simply pointers to specific commits, and the HEAD points to the currently checked-out branch.

## Index/Staging Area: 

The index, also known as the staging area, serves as a middle ground between the working directory and the repository. It contains a list of changes that are ready to be committed.

## Three-stage Model: 

Git operates on a three-stage model: the working directory, the index, and the repository. Files start in the working directory, are staged in the index, and then committed to the repository.

## Hashing and Compression: 

Git uses cryptographic hashing and compression techniques to efficiently store and manage objects within the repository. This ensures data integrity and reduces storage overhead.

## Distributed Architecture: 

Git is a distributed version control system, which means each user has a complete copy of the repository, including its entire history. Users can work offline and share changes with others through pushes and pulls.

In summary, Git's architecture revolves around storing snapshots of the project's state using objects, tracking changes through commits, and enabling collaboration through branches and a distributed model. It employs efficient data structures and algorithms to manage version control operations effectively.
